About:
After messing with Mario's jump height and gravity with hex edits 
I found "floaty" physics interesting and though it would be 
a nice gimmick to base a level around.

It is my first level and first SMWCentral content submission.

I had a lot of fun completing this and hope to continue creating 
in the future!
