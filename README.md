# QLDC 2023 Levels

This repository has all of the levels submitted to SMW Central's "[Questionable Level Design Contest #2](https://smwc.me/t/123442)".

## Patching

To patch all the entries, open `flips.exe` and when picking a BPS you can select all of the level patches to bulk apply them to your clean copy of Super Mario World. These can then be used in the emulator or on the console of your choosing.

If you would like to use the script to patch only the winners, place your copy of Super Mario World here and rename it to `smw.sfc` and run the provided `patch_award_winners.bat` script by double-clicking it, Flips will take care of the rest.

If you are a creator and would like to update your level patch, do reach out to me ([AmperSam](https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=profile&id=41223)) and I will do my best to include it here.
